    <p>The Japanese word for vinegared things, with a meaning similar to a salad. Sunomono ingredients may be raw or cooked and include items like broccoli, cabbage, carrots, cauliflower, celery, cucumber, daikon, lettuce, mushrooms, onions, pea pods, spinach, string beans, seaweed and sometimes seafood, meat or poultry. The salad-like ingredients are coated with vinegar that's usually sweetened with sugar and flavored with various seasonings.</p>

<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>2 Japanese or Persian cucumbers</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1 tbsp dried wakame seaweed</li>
    <li>1/2 tbsp toasted white sesame seeds</li>
</ul>
<h2>For Dressing</h2>
<ul>
    <li>4 tbsp rice vinegar</li>
    <li>2 tbsp sugar</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp kosher salt</li>
    <li>1/2 tsp soy sauce</li>
</ul>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>In a bowl, combine the rice vinegar, sugar, salt, and soy sauce. Whisk well together. If the vinegar tastes too strong, you can dilute it with a very small amount of dashi (Japanese soup stock), vegan dashi, or water.</li>
    <li>Soak the dried wakame seaweed in water and let it rehydrate for 10 minutes.</li>
    <li>Peel the skin of the cucumbers, leaving some skin on to create stripes. Then, slice them thinly into rounds.</li>
    <li>Sprinkle the salt on the slices and gently massage it in. Set aside for 5 minutes. The salt helps draw out the moisture from the cucumbers (so it does not dilute the salad dressing after mixing).</li>
    <li>Squeeze out the liquid from the rehydrated wakame seaweed and cucumbers. Add them to the bowl with the dressing and toss it all together. </li>
    </ol>
