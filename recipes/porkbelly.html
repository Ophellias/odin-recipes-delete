<h1>Ingredients</h1>
<ul>
    <li>12 ounces learn, skin-on pork belly</li>
    <li>2 tbsp oil</li>
    <li>1 tbsp rock sugar ( preferred ) or granulated sugar</li>
    <li>3 tbsp shaoxing wine</li>

<h1>Steps</h1>
<ol>
    <li>Cut pork belly into 3/4-inch thick pieces</li>
    <li>Bring a pot of water to a boil. Blanch the pork belly pieces for a couple minutes. This gets rid of impurities and starts the cooking process. Take the pork out of the pot, rinse, and set aside.</li>
    <li>Over low heat, add the oil and sugar to your wok. Melt the sugar slightly and add the pork. Raise the heat to medium and cook until the pork is lightly browned.</li>
    <li>Turn the heat back down to low and add shaoxing cooking wine, regular soy sauce, dark soy sauce, and water.<br><em><strong>NOTE :</strong>It's very important to the color and flavor of this dish that you have both kinds of soy sauce.</li>
    <li>Cover and simmer over medium heat for about 45 minutes to 1 hour until pork is fork tender. Every 5-10 minutes, stir to prevent burning and add more water if it gets too dry.</li>
    <li>Once the pork is fork tender, if there is still a lot of visible liquid, uncover the wok, turn up the heat, and stir continuously until the sauce has reduced to a glistening coating.</li>
</ol>
